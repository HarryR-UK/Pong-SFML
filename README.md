# Pong-SFML
My first SFML project, using C++ and the SFML library. 

# CONTROLS
Use either the up and down arrow keys, or 'W' and 'S' to move the player up and down

# ABOUT
A pong game which gets a lot harder very quickly. First to 5 points wins.

This was mainly developed as a learning process rather than to be used as a finished product, I am still coming to terms with SFML so a few sections of my code may look a bit strange, or unnecessary, however bare in mind my current experience with the library.
